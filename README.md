## WARNINGS:

There are secrets in this website, if you do not wish to be spoiled of these secrets, I would advise only looking into the Enter the Homegeon pages/files (`eth` folder in both the `html` and the `css` folders)

### UPDATE:

There *were* secrets in this project's code, however, they didn't amount to anything, so you may just encounter them in the form of remnants of incomplete and unintelligible code. sorry :(
